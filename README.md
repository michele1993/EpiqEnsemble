**Overview**

Here, I use an ensemble approach to approximate a distribution over value fuctions as well as transition models to get an estimate of the epistemic uncertainty over value predictions.
Since RL algorithms are heavily affected by out-of-distribution transitions, achieving good uncertainty estimates over value predictions can greatly mitigate this problem. 

**EpiqEnsemble**

Here, I implement a model-based ensemble version of the [TD3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09477) algorithm. 
Specifially, I adopt an ensemble architecture for both the critic and the transition model, pairing each network in the critic ensemble with a network in the transition model ensemble. 
Next, I train the critic ensemble based on a [Dyna](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9781558601413500304) approach.
Specifically, I train each critic network with the 'synthetic' one step transitions generated by the paired network in the transition ensemble. 
Crucially, each network in the transition model ensemble should predict a slightly different transition given the same state-action pair, which will then be reflected on how each (paired) critic network is updated.
As a result, the critic ensemble should come to reflect the model uncertainty over the distribution of transitions, instead of only the uncertainty over the value estimates.
